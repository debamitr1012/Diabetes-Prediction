# Diabetes-Prediction

Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning : Here we will be predicting that whether the patient has diabetes or not on the basis of the features we will provide to our machine learning model. Dataset Link: https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database

Conclusion : After using all these patient records, we are able to build a machine learning model random forest is the best one to accurately predict whether or not the patients in the dataset have diabetes or not along with that we were able to draw some insights from the data via data analysis and visualization.
